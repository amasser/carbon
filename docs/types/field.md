## Fields

_Fields_ are the primary way to tell carbon which values of an entry to use in its operators.
Most often, these will be things like fields to parse for a parser operator, or the field to write a new value to.

Fields are `.`-delimited strings which allow you to select labels or records on the entry. Fields can currently be used to select labels or values on a record. To select a label, prefix your field with `$label.` such as with `$label.my_label`. For values on the record, use the prefix `$record.` such as `$record.my_value`.

Record fields can be nested arbitrarily deeply, such as `$record.my_value.my_nested_value`.

If a field does not start with either `$label` or `$record`, `$record` is assumed. For example, `my_value` is equivalent to `$record.my_value`.

## Examples

Using fields with the restructure operator.

Config:
```yaml
- type: restructure
  ops:
    - add:
        field: "key3"
        value: "value3"
    - remove: "$record.key2.nested_key1"
    - add:
        field: "$labels.my_label"
        value: "my_label_value"
```

<table>
<tr><td> Input entry </td> <td> Output entry </td></tr>

```json

  "timestamp": "",

    }
  }
